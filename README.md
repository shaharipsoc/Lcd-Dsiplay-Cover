I tried to design a slim enclosure again using a channel outside between the top and bottom part to let the case apear more flat - and, to cover possible impressisions ;-).
I recommend to print the parts in different colors.

To fasten the controller board to the bottom part, first put the distance cylinders between the boards and use metrical screws M3 x 12 (14).
Both will work without tapping before.
There is no room for hexagonal pockets in the top part. You can screw M3 x 16 directly into it.

The second bottom part contains several screw nut deepenings for fastening the case as you like. If you mount it to an 8 mm rod you can use the case clamps.
If the cables are plugged in, the case inevitably has a slope of 6Â°. In case you need more slope:

LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) is a type of flat panel display which uses liquid crystals in its primary form of operation. LEDs have a large and varying set of use cases for consumers and businesses, as they can be commonly found in smartphones, televisions, computer monitors and instrument panels.

LCDs were a big leap in terms of the technology they replaced, which include light-emitting diode (LED) and gas-plasma displays. LCDs allowed displays to be much thinner than cathode ray tube (CRT) technology.
LCDs consume much less power than LED and gas-display displays because they work on the principle of blocking light rather than emitting it. Where an LED emits light, the liquid crystals in an LCD produces an image using a backlight

And yes, don't forget to assemble the distance cylinders - the display's board won't like it ;-)
